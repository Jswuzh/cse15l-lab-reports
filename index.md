# cd command
cd command is to change working directory, when run empty, it will go to root directory.
If we have some path like /home/lecture1/message/page.png, cd command with empty argument will return to /home directory
if command with argument, with path and files name, if only include files name, that must be in the current working directory
if no such files name, it return can't find files name, if with path, such as cd /home/lecture1/message, the working directory
will go to message file.
